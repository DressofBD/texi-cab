        <p style="text-align: center;">The following terms and conditions are valid for all reservations made via our Airport Taxis website. We recommend that you read these conditions thoroughly before completing a reservation.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The following definitions apply and are used in our terms and conditions:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. ABOUT US</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are responsible for transfers and transfer services for both groups and individuals. We also trade under the name "website.com", which is fully owned by us. Our registered office is Library Square, Main Street, Rathcoole, Dublin Ireland.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Our services are delivered via: <a href="https://airporttaxis.stylemix.biz//">www.website.com</a> &nbsp; and the corresponding mail address info@website.com. Our transfer services are in accordance with national laws and regulations and for this we also have all necessary permits and licenses. In order to properly handle the transfers, we only call upon professional transfer companies that offer these services for individuals or we act as a company that has the capacity to offer these transfer services.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Airport Taxis offers transport services for both individuals and groups via the website.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">These terms and conditions must be read and understood by any person who intends to make a reservation through our website as these conditions apply to each contract. Whoever makes a reservation automatically states that he has read and agreed to these terms and conditions. The person making the reservation in this way gives both his personal agreement and the agreement of the passengers for which he / she has the legal capacity to do so. If you have questions about these conditions, you can always contact our customer service. If for any reason you cannot agree with these conditions, then you should not make a reservation via our transport service.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. ONLINE RESERVATIONS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The person who completes the reservation process must be at least 18 years old. This person is also responsible for introducing the correct data and for carrying out the full payment. The online reservation process must be strictly followed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The conclusion of a contract with Airport Taxis requires the administrative handling of a number of issues in order to be able to carry out our transport services correctly.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The validity of the contract only comes into effect if you have received a transport service voucher via e-mail. If the purchased services cannot be delivered by the transport company, the customer will be informed of this and the full amount will be refunded to the customer's account. After repayment, we no longer have any liabilities or responsibilities towards the customer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Recognition of all sent notifications is a responsibility of the customer. We expect you to recognize every correspondence. If this is not the case, we will consider the data on our mail server as proof of notification.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Confirmation of a payment as such is not considered to be contractually binding.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The vouchers that you have received after payment for our Transfers have to be printed so that they can be shown to the driver of the taxi. If the Principal Passenger is unable to present the voucher at the time of the Transfer Service, the driver can refuse the Transport Service. In addition to the voucher, the Principal Passenger is also expected to print a printout of all correspondence and bring it with him.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned earlier, the person making the reservation must be at least 18 years old. If this is not the case, then we are authorized to cancel the reservation at any time. A parent or legal guardian who is aware of the reservation of his / her minor we advise to contact us so that we can cancel the reservation immediately. Minors are also not allowed to use our Transport Services without adult supervision.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. PAYMENT OF THE TRANSPORT SERVICE</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">For the payment of the Transport service all current payment methods including credit card (American Express, MasterCard / Diners International, Visa), payment card (Visa / Delta, Visa / Electron), bank transfer and PayPal are offered. If you wish to make use of PayPal, please note that this payment method is only possible for larger amounts and that in this case an additional surcharge will be charged.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Our rates always apply in euros. If a conversion of currency takes place during the payment or reservation, this conversion is not our responsibility.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Reservation Voucher always contains the details of the collection point and the order. If the reservation voucher still contains incorrect data, then changes can only be made and implemented by sending them to &nbsp; <a href="mailto:info@website.com">info@website.com</a> &nbsp; to communicate. The changes must be requested for the actual transfer and are only valid if the Transport Company has received them correctly and an official confirmation by the Transport Company has been done by mail.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">If the change in data is accompanied by the necessary additional costs, these costs are fully the liability of the customer. At Airport Taxis, an initial change can always be made free of charge. For each additional change an administration fee of 15 euros can be charged. If the change takes place within 24 hours, a refund is not necessary.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">When the contract becomes legally binding, the Customer is requested to inform our Customer Service of possible errors contained therein, not less than 24 hours prior to the corresponding Transfer Service. If you have informed us within 24 hours before the associated transfer service, we can terminate the Contract free of charge.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">6. CANCELLATIONS BY THE CUSTOMER</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Cancellations by the Customer are only valid if they have been sent by mail to our Customer Service in writing: <a href="mailto:info@website.com">info@website.com</a> .Cancellations can be made for an entire Reservation or for parts of the Reservation.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">For cancellations that take place more than 24 hours before actual collection, a full refund of the Reservation in question applies. For cancellations that take place less than 24 hours before the actual collection, no compensation will be paid on our behalf. After Cancellation you will receive an official cancellation confirmation from our Transport Company via e-mail.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">7. LAST-MINUTE RESERVATIONS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Last-minute reservations depend on the season and the route to be traveled. In case of last-minute reservations, we advise you to contact us if the website mentions this. This way we can check whether we can still deliver the Transport service. Chapter 5, 6 and 8 always apply to last-minute reservations.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">8. CHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS BY THE TRANSPORT</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In exceptional cases, it may be possible for the Transport Company to apply changes to the Transport Service or to cancel the Transport Service. In this case, the Transport Company always informs the customer of this as soon as possible.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We always try to meet the requirements and wishes of our customers, but in exceptional cases it would be necessary to call on a larger or more cars. If the vehicle in question is in a lower category than the vehicle you reserved, the difference in fare will be refunded to the Customer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In very exceptional cases, the reservation will be canceled. In the event of cancellation of a reservation, the full amount will be refunded to the customer. After reimbursing the amount, the Transport Company will bear no further responsibility or responsibility. As a Transport company we will do everything possible to help you further by offering alternatives for the reservation.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">9. THE USE OF CHILD SEATS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">For child seats, both national and international rules apply which vary from country to country. As a Transport Company, however, we comply with all the rules that apply to our cars according to the legislation. When reserving a private transfer, we always ask the customer to use a car seat booster or child seat for children younger than 12 years or less than 135 cm. As a transport company, we attach great importance to safety and as a customer you will be able to opt for child seats or baby seats for most reservations.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">It is the complete responsibility of the main passenger to check whether the child seats used comply with the necessary requirements and that the child seats are correctly used and installed. As a Transport Company, we bear no responsibility or liability with regard to the use, inspection or installation of the child seat in question.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The use of a personal booster or personal baby seat is possible, but must be communicated to the Transport Company in advance. In this way, as a Transport Company, we can ensure that the used vehicle can accommodate the booster or the seat. If you wish to bring your own car seat booster or child seat and travel with a private transfer, you must inform us in advance. This allows us to check whether the vehicle supplied by the Transport company is suitable for the child seat. Group services are usually provided by a minibus or bus, and it is not possible to use a child seat in these vehicles.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As a Transport Company, we always offer everything possible to provide the child seats that were requested during the Reservation. In exceptional cases it could happen that the child seat cannot be provided. If an extra charge has been made for the child seat during the Reservation, this compensation will of course be reimbursed in this case. If there is no child seat, children from 3 years of age can still use our Transport service if they wear the adult safety belt. Children younger than 3 years old can and may also use our Transport Service without a child seat if they therefore take place in the back of the car.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">10. PRICES FOR CHILDREN</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Children and babies must be seen as regular passengers during the reservation. They must therefore be entered as full-fledged passengers during the reservation and the applicable rate will also be charged for this.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">11. TRANSPORT PASSENGERS WITH A PHYSICAL RESTRICTION OR PASSENGERS WITH WHEELCHAIR</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Passengers with a disability or passengers who use a wheelchair from our Transport Service must inform our Transport Company in advance. We are not specialized in the transport of these customers, but will enable everything to be transported in an appropriate manner. It is important that these customers are able to get on and off the vehicle independently or with the help of other fellow passengers. When transporting wheelchairs, we are only able to transport collapsible wheelchairs. We cannot guarantee the use of the vehicle for such customers at this time.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">12. RESERVATION EXTRA INTERMEDIATE STOP</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, a stopover during the use of our transport service, for example to pick up extra people, a wish of the customer. These extra stopovers can and must be indicated during the online reservation. It is important to note that the final destination is the same for all passengers. The duration of a stopover may not exceed a maximum of 5 minutes.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">13. TRAVEL INSURANCE</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As a Transport company, we always advise our customers to take out tailor-made travel insurance. Always ensure that the travel insurance meets your needs. Always print the coverage of the travel insurance and take it with you during the trip. We always recommend travel insurance so that you have sufficient cover in all circumstances and are not faced with unexpected costs.<br>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">14. OUR LIABILITY</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the event of non-compliance with these Terms and Conditions, we can only be held liable as a Transport Company for the loss or damage that can be linked to our negligence of these Terms and Conditions on the basis of proof. Loss or damage for which we are liable can also not exceed the amount that you have paid for the transfer. We are under no circumstances responsible and liable for so-called consequential or loss of loss that has been made unforeseen. We are also not responsible for all disruptions that cannot be directly linked to our services.

As Customer, it is your responsibility to be available on this mobile number. This accessibility already applies to the actual pick-up, such as when waiting for the baggage or during the customs check. If we cannot reach you on this mobile number, we cannot guarantee your transport and our obligations will lapse to you without a refund of the amount already paid. If you are not picked up at the airport, we need to receive your call within ten minutes of your planned pick-up time. All calls that our customer service reaches are kept by an external company so that they can be used as evidence in any disputes. These stored data therefore also count as legitimate evidence in these cases. If our transfer services are not used, no refund can be made here without prior warning and approval from our side. This also applies to the use of alternative Transport services. If an alternative transport is used, the costs will only be refunded if the Customer can present a valid proof of payment.
